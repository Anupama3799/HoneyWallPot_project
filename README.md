### Old Readme
pip install requirements.txt

sudo apt install python-twisted

python server.py

### Make sure:

Please make sure all the files have the rught permissions

chmod +x (filename)

for it to run via sudo

also make sure to make all your paths accessible via all machines.. I read somewhere in your code "G:/...." < remove this asap and make it a relative path

## How to run this?

Just run:

<pre><code>sh server.sh</code></pre>
